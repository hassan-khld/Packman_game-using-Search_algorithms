# Artiﬁcial Intelligence – Packman game using search algos



In this lab task you will help Pacman ﬁnd paths through his maze world in order to reach a particular location as well as to collect food eﬃciently. You will implement general search algorithms and model their heuristics, applying them to scenarios from the Pacman universe.

The code that describes the behavior of Pacman’s universe is already functional, while you simply need to implement the algorithms which will control the way Pacman moves. The code for the project consists of Python ﬁles, a part of which you just need to read and understand, a part of which you need to modify yourselves and a part that you can ignore. After you download and unpack the zip archive, you will see a list of ﬁles and folders which we brieﬂy describe below:
